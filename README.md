# CS246-Algorithms
This contains notes and programs implemented in C++ . (Notes have been discontinued)

**Programs/Algorithms**

1. **Elementary Binary Search**: A fundamental binary search program of an array of fixed length
2. **Trinary Search Algorithm**: This is a very rarely seen algorithm, I  came across this in one of my computer science courses. It has some glitches to be fixed on Jul 7 15


**Target-List(Upcoming algos)**

1. Binary Trees: insertion, traversal, valid binary tree?, removal, completer clarity.
2. Linked Lists
3. Stack
4. Queue
5. CS 246 assignment
